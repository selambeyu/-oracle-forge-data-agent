**Day 1 Full Post — Kidus (4:05 AM):**
> Our progress so far: Intelligence Officers focused on
LLM Knowledge Base. Drivers leading Inception Document
and architecture. Signal Corps responsible for
documenting progress and community engagement.
Decision: not using Tenai infrastructure for now.
Clear roles. Clear deliverables. Clear mission.

---

**Day 2 Full Posts — Kidus & Mistire:**

> Oracle Forge x Databricks 2026 — Multi-agent systems
grew 327% in 4 months. Companies using evaluation tools
get 6x more AI projects to production. Our harness
isn't overhead — it's the differentiator.

**Day 3 Full Posts — Mistire (2:12 AM & 4:38 AM):**

> OpenAI shared how they built an internal AI data
agent that turns plain English questions into reliable
data insights. Instead of just generating answers,
it finds the right data, runs queries, checks itself,
and explains results. Worth a read:
https://openai.com/index/inside-our-in-house-data-agent

> This is a good breakdown of Karpathy's idea of LLM
knowledge bases. Instead of RAG pipelines, the idea
is to have the LLM compile raw data into a structured,
evolving wiki that it can reason over. Feels very
relevant to what we're building around knowledge bases.

**Day 3 Infrastructure Update — Yosef (4:11 AM):**
> DataAgentBench repo cloned to shared instance with
all databases downloaded. Resolving directory structure
issue — will reference from individual directories
rather than root. Tutor guidance received and noted.

**Day 3 Tutor Guidance — Temesgen (4:25 AM):**
> Each team member clones org repo inside own
/home/<username> directory. Shared Docker setup
on instance — no separate installations needed.
For DAB evaluation, one Driver runs evaluation
testing for optimal resource usage.

---

**Day 4 Full Post — Kidus (Apr 11):**
> The team is progressing well and on track for
Tuesday's interim submission.
> - Estif and Melkam: Knowledge Base first draft
underway, all three context layers mapped,
source materials locked in
> - Yosef and Bethel: Inception document and
architecture diagram completed, infrastructure
setup moving forward over the weekend
> - Kidus and Mistire: External engagement live —
two X threads, Medium article published, Reddit
post at 867 views with community intelligence
on token optimisation feeding directly into
the architecture
>
> All roles are delivering and the team is aligned
heading into the final push before Tuesday.

---

**Day 5 Full Posts — Apr 13:**

after architecture discussion.
Blockage: permission issues on challenge repo —
communicating with Estif to resolve.

**Mistire (3:28 AM) — Action items shared with tutor:**
> Shared full team action items in response to
tutor check-in. All roles active and delivering.

**Kidus (3:39 AM) — Full progress update posted:**
> PaLM Team progress update shared in Slack —
newly shipped items per role, previously shipped
items, and action items for Tuesday.

**Mistire (8:40 AM) — Second Medium article published:**
> The Join Key Problem: Why the Same Customer Is
a Different Person in Every Database.
https://medium.com/@mistiredan/the-join-key-problem-why-the-same-customer-is-a-different-person-in-every-database-10985194c39c

  fail. How are you managing real-time consistency
  across different systems?"
  - Views: 14
  - **Our reply:**
  > "We are managing it by: A smart query planner
  that understands relationships across heterogeneous
  databases. Dynamic schema awareness + metadata
  synchronization. Built-in verification &
  self-correction loops to avoid bad joins or

- **Key tweets:**
  - 3-layer context: Schema & Metadata →
  Institutional Knowledge → Corrections Log
  - Token optimisation as hardest unsolved problem
  - DAB: 54 queries across 4 DB systems
  - Harness built before the agent
- **Notable replies received:**

  **@rivestack:**
  > "multi-db joins with mismatched schemas is
  exactly where things get messy. curious how
  you're handling schema normalization or just
  keeping native types per db and letting the
  agent figure it out?"
  - Views: 7
  - **Our reply URL:**
  https://x.com/Kidus5T99409/status/2042897418534924327
  - **Our reply:**
  > "Keeping native types per DB and putting
  resolution logic in the agent — specifically
  in Layer 2 of our context stack. We maintain
  a join key glossary that maps how the same
  entity appears differently across systems
  (e.g. integer in PostgreSQL vs 'CUST-00123'
  string in MongoDB). The agent checks this
  before attempting any cross-database join.
  Schema normalisation upfront felt too brittle
  for DAB's realistic enterprise data —
  the messiness is the point."

### Community Participation

#### Entry 1 — Reddit r/learnmachinelearning
- **Date:** April 10, 2026
- **Platform:** r/learnmachinelearning
- **Username:** u/ktewodros41
- **Post title:** "help Curious if anyone here has
tackled multi-database schema loading strategies"
- **Direct link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1shx8ag/help_curious_if_anyone_here_has_tackled/
- **Views:** 1,300+
- **Upvotes:** 2
- **Summary of post:**
  Asked the community about multi-database schema
  loading strategies — whether to load full schemas
  upfront or retrieve on demand. Shared DAB context:
  4 database systems, 54.3% leaderboard ceiling,
  Claude Code + OpenAI architecture synthesis,
  token optimisation challenge.
- **Responses received:**

  **u/Otherwise_Wave9374:**
  > Schema summaries + on-demand expansion: start
  with table-level stats and exemplar columns, pull
  full column lists only for candidate tables after
  first-pass query plan. Log join-key failures into
  compact fixup memory.

  **u/Sufficient_Might_228:**
  > Lazy loading per sub-query works better — loading
  full schemas upfront creates context bloat. Start
  with table names only, fetch column details for
  tables the LLM actually selects.

  **u/Foreign_Skill_6628:**
  > Schema-as-a-Database approach: load schemas into
  DuckDB or Neo4j, use semantic search via MCP server.
  Load as a Claude skill — activates only when invoked.

  **u/Nidhhiii18:**
  > On-demand retrieval per sub-query is almost always
  better. Cache a lightweight schema index — table
  names, column names, types — pull detailed metadata
  only when router picks a target DB. Keep rolling
  window of last N failures for corrections log.

- **Our replies:**
  - Acknowledged schema summaries + on-demand
  expansion as most sustainable approach
  - Agreed execution layer intelligence > expecting
  frontier model to hold entire DB world in context

the human refinement step at scale"
- **Direct link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1skrzsh/curious_how_others_are_handling_the_human/
- **Views:** 383
- **Upvotes:** 1
- **Summary of post:**
  Referenced a16z piece on data agent context layers.
  Described three real failures: business definitions
  not in schema, semantically wrong data sources,
  context that decayed over time. Asked community
  how to balance tribal knowledge capture vs
  corrections loop discovery.
- **Key insight shared:**
  > "For a benchmark this is solvable — the tribal
  knowledge is in the DAB paper and dataset
  documentation. For a real enterprise deployment
  it is not. The context layer is a sociotechnical
  problem, not just a technical one."
- **Responses received:** None yet — monitoring
- **Community intel extracted:** Sociotechnical
  framing resonating — 383 views confirms practitioners
  are reading

#### Entry 3 — Reddit r/AI_Agents
- **Date:** April 11, 2026
- **Platform:** r/AI_Agents
- **Username:** u/ktewodros41
- **Post title:** "Curious if anyone else has applied
this to agentic systems — specifically how you handle
the maintain phase when the KB grows faster than you
can injection-test it"
- **Direct link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1sitlhf/curious_if_anyone_else_has_applied_this_to/
- **Views:** 667
- **Upvotes:** 2
- **Summary of post:**
  Applied Karpathy's 4-phase KB method to data agent.
  Key finding: corrections log outperformed static
  domain knowledge. Discussed removal over accumulation
  discipline and injection test as quality gate.
- **Responses received:**

  **u/Sufficient_Dig207 (Reply 1):**
  > "Thanks for sharing. Wonder how you hook this up
  to a coding agent — is it replacing a skill? If not,
  how do they complement each other?"

  **u/Sufficient_Dig207 (Reply 2):**
  > "And wonder whether this is helpful, instead of
  uploading info, you just connect and query tools
  to build the wiki."
  Shared: github.com/ZhixiangLuo/10xProductivity

- **Community intel extracted:**
  How KB complements agent skills is a genuine
  architectural question — flagged to Intelligence
  Officers for KB v3 documentation. 10xProductivity
  tool worth reviewing for maintain phase automation.

- **Direct link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1sll6z2/help_we_discovered_that_some_enterprise_datasets/
- **Views:** 250
- **Upvotes:** 0
- **Summary of post:**
  Shared the discovery that some DAB datasets embed
  location data, category information, and status
  indicators inside free-text description fields
  with no dedicated column. Asked community three
  questions: extraction as pre-processing vs inside
  query execution, how to handle extraction failures
  or ambiguous results, whether there is a reliable
  way to detect which fields need extraction without
  manual inventory.

- **Summary of post:**
  Same post cross-posted to r/aiagents for broader
  reach in the agent-building community.
- **Responses received:**

  **u/Inevitable_Raccoon_9:**
  > "I didnt face such question with DB while coding
  but I had same problems with lots of texts that
  were unstructured too. Literally told OPUS the
  problem and he just read the hundreds of texts
  and analysed them — then told me 'I can write a
  script that extracts all data like you need it.'
  It was literally just grep against the data — and
  a script is way faster than an AI. My advice —
  just rewrite your text with a bit more explanation
  and feed it into OPUS (when in intelligent mode)."

  **Our reply:**
  > "That is actually a really useful framing — and
  the grep approach is underrated for fields where
  the structure is consistent enough. If location
  always appears in the same position or format,
  a well-crafted script will outperform an LLM call
  every time on speed and reliability.
  >
  > The challenge we are hitting is specifically the
  inconsistent cases. Some of our DAB datasets have
  description fields where the same type of
  information appears in three or four different
  formats across records — sometimes abbreviated,
  sometimes spelled out, sometimes missing entirely.
  Pattern matching works on the clean subset and
  breaks on the rest. That is the part we are still
  figuring out.
  >
  > What we are leaning toward is a tiered approach:
  try pattern matching first, fall back to an LLM
  extraction call only for records where the pattern
  fails, and flag any record where extraction returns
  ambiguous results rather than silently passing a
  low-confidence answer downstream. The silent wrong
  answer is the failure mode we are most worried
  about — an extraction that looks correct but is
  not will corrupt every aggregation that depends on it.
  >
  > The OPUS suggestion for designing the extraction
  script is well taken though. We have been thinking
  about this as a runtime problem but you are right
  that a well-designed pre-processing script could
  handle a significant chunk of it before the agent
  ever runs. Worth testing whether a one-time
  extraction pass over the known fields could be
  committed to the KB as structured data rather than
  requiring the agent to re-extract at query time.
  >
  > Thanks for sharing — the dry run mode detail is
  a good practical tip."

- **Community intel extracted:**
  Tiered extraction approach validated — pattern
  matching first, LLM fallback only for inconsistent
  records. Pre-processing pass committed to KB as
  structured data is worth testing. Dry run mode
  for extraction scripts is a practical tip worth
  implementing. Flagged to Intelligence Officers
  for unstructured field inventory documentation.
- **Impact on team:**
  The reply forced the team to publicly commit to
  the tiered extraction approach — pattern matching
  first, LLM fallback, flag ambiguous results rather
  than silently passing low-confidence answers. This
  is now the confirmed extraction strategy documented
  in the KB unstructured field inventory.

#### Entry 6 — Reddit r/learnmachinelearning
- **Date:** April 15, 2026
- **Platform:** r/learnmachinelearning
- **Username:** u/Admirable_Salary_326
- **Post title:** "question For teams that have run
agents against real enterprise data, how do you
distinguish between a data quality failure and a
domain knowledge gap?"
- **Direct link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1smipwi/question_for_teams_that_have_run_agents_against/
- **Views:** 123
- **Upvotes:** 1
- **Note:** Post was removed by Reddit's filters
  after initial posting — still visible but limited
  distribution
- **Summary of post:**
  Described five failure categories classified before
  running the benchmark. Syntax — tool name resolution
  HTTP 404. Data quality — null constraint violations.
  Wrong DB type — PostgreSQL queries sent to SQLite
  twice. Asked community how to distinguish data
  quality failures from domain knowledge gaps.
- **Responses received:**

  **u/theShku:**
  > "How are you handling your semantic layers?"
  - Reply URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1smipwi/comment/ogej5xq/

  **Our reply:**
  > "We are not using a traditional semantic layer
  in the BI sense — no LookML, no dbt metrics, no
  centralised metric store. Instead we built an
  institutional knowledge layer — three structured
  markdown documents injected directly into the
  agent's context before it answers any question.
  Domain term definitions with dataset-specific
  mappings. Dataset overview covering join strategies
  and authoritative table designations. Corrections
  log — append-only log of every failure structured
  as query that failed, why it failed, correct
  approach. The key difference: designed to be
  injected into a context window, not queried.
  No embeddings, no retrieval, no vector search.
  Every document must pass an injection test before
  it is committed."
  - Our reply URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1smipwi/comment/ogenrwc/

  **u/theShku counter-reply:**
  > "We're following recommended OSI standards for
  context grounding.
  https://open-semantic-interchange.org/"

- **Community intel extracted:**
  OSI standards for context grounding surfaced as
  a new framework worth reviewing for structuring
  KB documents more formally in future sprints.
  open-semantic-interchange.org flagged for
  Intelligence Officers. The injection-first
  articulation is now the canonical external
  description of Layer 2.
- **Impact on team:**
  Forced precise commitment to how we describe
  Layer 2 externally. OSI standard is new community
  intelligence. The injection-first framing is now
  the canonical description the team uses.

### Community Intelligence Gathered

| Date | Source | Platform | Intel | Impact on Team |
|------|--------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Apr 9 | @fabiolauria92 | X | SME fragmented data is real production pain point — real-time consistency is core challenge | Confirms we are targeting the right problem — changed how Signal Corps framed all subsequent posts |
| Apr 9 | @rivestack | X | Schema normalisation vs native types per DB — active practitioner debate | Validates join key glossary approach — Estif and Melkam built KB v2 glossary immediately after |
| Apr 10 | u/Otherwise_Wave9374 | Reddit | Schema summaries + on-demand expansion — table stats first, full columns only for candidate tables | First of four practitioners converging on lazy loading — brought to mob session |
| Apr 10 | u/Sufficient_Might_228 | Reddit | Lazy loading per sub-query — table names only, expand on selection | Second independent source confirming lazy loading |
| Apr 10 | u/Foreign_Skill_6628 | Reddit | Schema-as-a-Database via DuckDB/Neo4j + MCP semantic search | Novel approach flagged to Intelligence Officers for KB v2 |
| Apr 10 | u/Nidhhiii18 | Reddit | On-demand retrieval confirmed better, lightweight schema index cache, rolling window for corrections log | Fourth independent practitioner confirming lazy loading — rolling window optimisation worth implementing |
| Apr 11 | u/Sufficient_Dig207 | Reddit r/AI_Agents | How does KB approach hook up to a coding agent — does it replace a skill or complement it | Genuine architectural question flagged to Intelligence Officers for KB v3 documentation |
| Apr 15 | u/theShku | Reddit | How are you handling your semantic layers — forced distinction between injection-first KB and traditional BI semantic layer | Forced precise articulation of Layer 2 — now standard external framing for the team |
| Apr 15 | u/theShku | Reddit | OSI standards for context grounding — open-semantic-interchange.org | New community intelligence — flagged to Intelligence Officers for future sprint KB structuring |
| Apr 17 | u/Inevitable_Raccoon_9 | Reddit r/aiagents | Grep + script approach for consistent fields. OPUS for script generation. Dry run mode. Pre-processing pass committed to KB as structured data | Confirmed tiered extraction approach — pattern matching first, LLM fallback for inconsistent records, flag ambiguous results rather than silently passing low-confidence answers |

**Token optimisation — RESOLVED:**
Four independent practitioners converged on the same
answer: load table names first, expand to full columns
only for tables selected after first-pass query
planning. Use rolling window on corrections log
rather than full history. Architecture decision
confirmed.

**Join key glossary — VALIDATED:**
@rivestack independently raised the debate. Native
types per DB with Layer 2 glossary confirmed as
correct. Built immediately after the reply.

**Institutional knowledge vs semantic layer —
CLARIFIED:**
u/theShku's question forced a public distinction
between our injection-first markdown approach and
traditional BI semantic layers. This is now the
standard framing the team uses for Layer 2 externally.
OSI standards surfaced as new intelligence.

**Embedded structured data extraction — PARTIALLY RESOLVED:**
u/Inevitable_Raccoon_9 on r/aiagents suggested
grep + script approach for consistent fields and
OPUS for script generation. Our reply committed
the team to a tiered approach: pattern matching
first, LLM fallback for inconsistent records,
flag ambiguous results. Pre-processing pass
committed to KB is worth testing.

  agents. Same customer stored as integer 10023 in
  PostgreSQL and 'CUST-10023' in MongoDB. DAB
  benchmark context — 54 queries, 4 database systems,
  54% best score. Fix: join key glossary injected
  into agent context at session start. Core lesson:

- **Responses received:**

  **u/Inevitable_Raccoon_9:**
  > "I didnt face such question with DB while coding
  but I had same problems with lots of texts that
  were unstructured. Literally told OPUS the problem
  and he read the hundreds of texts and analysed
  them — then told me 'I can write a script that
  extracts all data like you need it.' It was
  literally just grep against the data — and a
  script is way faster than an AI."

  **Our reply:**
  > "That is actually a really useful framing — and
  the grep approach is underrated for fields where
  the structure is consistent enough. The challenge
  we are hitting is specifically the inconsistent
  cases — same type of information appearing in
  three or four different formats across records.
  What we are leaning toward is a tiered approach:
  try pattern matching first, fall back to an LLM
  extraction call only for records where the pattern
  fails, and flag any record where extraction returns
  ambiguous results rather than silently passing a
  low-confidence answer downstream. The silent wrong
  answer is the failure mode we are most worried
  about. The OPUS suggestion for designing the
  extraction script is well taken — a one-time
  extraction pass over the known fields could be
  committed to the KB as structured data rather than
  requiring the agent to re-extract at query time."

- **Community intel extracted:**
  Tiered extraction approach confirmed — pattern
  matching first, LLM fallback for inconsistent
  records. Pre-processing pass committed to KB
  worth testing. Dry run mode is a practical tip.

- **Direct link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1smipwi/question_for_teams_that_have_run_agents_against/
- **Views:** 123
- **Upvotes:** 1
- **Note:** Post removed by Reddit's filters after
  initial posting — still visible but limited reach
- **Responses received:**

  **u/theShku:**
  > "How are you handling your semantic layers?"

  **Our reply:**
  > "We are not using a traditional semantic layer
  — no LookML, no dbt metrics. Instead we built an
  institutional knowledge layer — three structured
  markdown documents injected directly into the
  agent's context. Domain term definitions, dataset
  overview, and corrections log. Designed to be
  injected into a context window, not queried. No
  embeddings, no vector search. Every document must
  pass an injection test before committed."
  - Our reply URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1smipwi/comment/ogenrwc/

  **u/theShku counter-reply:**
  > "We're following recommended OSI standards for
  context grounding.
  https://open-semantic-interchange.org/"

- **Community intel extracted:**
  OSI standards for context grounding surfaced.
  open-semantic-interchange.org flagged for
  Intelligence Officers. Injection-first articulation
  now canonical external description of Layer 2.

### Week 9 Community Intelligence

| Date | Source | Platform | Intel | Impact on Team |
|------|--------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Apr 15 | u/theShku | Reddit | Semantic layers question — forced distinction between injection-first KB and traditional BI semantic layer | Forced precise articulation of Layer 2 — now standard external framing |
| Apr 15 | u/theShku | Reddit | OSI standards for context grounding — open-semantic-interchange.org | New community intelligence — flagged to Intelligence Officers |
| Apr 17 | u/Inevitable_Raccoon_9 | Reddit r/aiagents | Grep + script approach for consistent fields. OPUS for script generation. Pre-processing pass committed to KB. | Confirmed tiered extraction approach — pattern matching first, LLM fallback, flag ambiguous results |

**Embedded structured data extraction — PARTIALLY RESOLVED:**
u/Inevitable_Raccoon_9 suggested grep + OPUS
approach. Our reply committed team to tiered
extraction: pattern matching first, LLM fallback
for inconsistent records, flag ambiguous results.
Pre-processing pass committed to KB worth testing.
