### X / Twitter Community Engagement

#### Interaction 1 — @fabiolauria92
- **Date:** April 9, 2026
- **Platform:** X / Twitter
- **Thread URL:** https://x.com/Kidus5T99409/status/2042344151518232998
- **Their comment:**
  > "The multi-database approach stands out because
  that's precisely where most analytics solutions
  fail. Small and medium enterprises often struggle
  with data scattered across systems, manually
  piecing together insights. The real challenge
  isn't data volume but extracting intelligence
  from fragmented sources. How are you managing
  real-time consistency across different systems?"
- **Views on their reply:** 14
- **Our reply:**
  > "We are managing it by: A smart query planner
  that understands relationships across
  heterogeneous databases. Dynamic schema
  awareness + metadata synchronization. Built-in
  verification & self-correction loops to avoid
  bad joins or stale assumptions."
- **Community intel extracted:**
  Real-world validation that SMEs struggle with
  fragmented data across systems — real-time
  consistency is a known production pain point,
  not just a benchmark edge case
- **Impact on team:**
  Confirms our architecture is targeting the
  right problem. Worth referencing in Week 9
  article as external validation from a
  practitioner

#### Interaction 2 — @rivestack
- **Date:** April 9, 2026
- **Platform:** X / Twitter
- **Thread URL:** https://x.com/Kidus5T99409/status/2042344151518232998
- **Their comment:**
  > "multi-db joins with mismatched schemas is
  exactly where things get messy. curious how
  you're handling schema normalization or just
  keeping native types per db and letting the
  agent figure it out?"
- **Views on their reply:** 7
- **Our reply:**
  > "Keeping native types per DB and putting
  resolution logic in the agent — specifically
  in Layer 2 of our context stack. We maintain
  a join key glossary that maps how the same
  entity appears differently across systems
  (e.g. integer in PostgreSQL vs 'CUST-00123'
  string in MongoDB). The agent checks this
  before attempting any cross-database join.
  Schema normalisation upfront felt too brittle
  for DAB's realistic enterprise data —
  the messiness is the point."
- **Community intel extracted:**
  Active practitioner asking about our exact
  design decision — schema normalisation vs
  native types. Validates that this is a
  real engineering debate in the field
- **Impact on team:**
  Validates our join key glossary approach.
  Document this decision explicitly in
  KB v2 domain layer. Flag for Estif
  and Melkam

### Reddit Community Engagement

#### Interaction 3 — u/Otherwise_Wave9374
- **Date:** April 10, 2026
- **Platform:** r/learnmachinelearning
- **Post URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1shx8ag/help_curious_if_anyone_here_has_tackled/
- **Their comment:**
  > "Schema summaries + on-demand expansion:
  start with table-level stats and a few
  exemplar columns, then pull full column
  lists only for the candidate tables after
  a first pass query plan. Also logging
  join-key failures into a compact fixup
  memory that is referenced before the
  next tool call."
- **Our reply:**
  > "The schema summaries + on-demand expansion
  approach feels like the most sustainable way
  to keep the agent from drowning in metadata
  before it even hits the execution phase.
  I especially like the idea of starting with
  table-level stats — it forces the agent to
  commit to a path before eating up tokens
  with full column lists."
- **Community intel extracted:**
  Schema summaries + on-demand expansion as
  a practical token optimisation strategy.
  Start with table-level stats, expand only
  for candidate tables after first-pass
  query plan
- **Impact on team:**
  Directly addresses token optimisation open
  question. Bring to next mob session as
  proposed solution

#### Interaction 4 — u/Sufficient_Might_228
- **Date:** April 10, 2026
- **Platform:** r/learnmachinelearning
- **Post URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1shx8ag/help_curious_if_anyone_here_has_tackled/
- **Their comment:**
  > "Lazy loading per sub-query works better
  for multi-database agents — loading full
  schemas upfront creates massive context
  bloat and kills token efficiency, especially
  across 4+ databases. Start with table names
  only, then fetch column details + sample
  rows just for tables the LLM actually
  selects."
- **Our reply:**
  > "That's a fair point on the why behind
  the failure. It's rarely about the model's
  ability to write SQL and almost always about
  the lack of environmental awareness. I really
  appreciate the suggestion to move more of
  the intelligence into the execution layer
  rather than expecting the frontier model to
  hold the entire database world in its head."
- **Community intel extracted:**
  Lazy loading per sub-query confirmed as
  better approach than full schema upfront.
  Table names only first, then fetch column
  details + sample rows for selected tables
- **Impact on team:**
  Validates lazy loading approach. Aligns
  with on-demand expansion from
  Interaction 3. Two independent sources
  pointing same direction

#### Interaction 5 — u/Foreign_Skill_6628
- **Date:** April 10, 2026
- **Platform:** r/learnmachinelearning
- **Post URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1shx8ag/help_curious_if_anyone_here_has_tackled/
- **Their comment:**
  > "Try a Schema-as-a-Database approach. Load
  your schemas in a structured format into
  DuckDB or Neo4j, use semantic search on top
  of that to expose your database using tool
  calls via an MCP server. You can load this
  entire workflow as a skill in Claude and it
  would only take up a few KB of space until
  the skill is invoked in the conversation."
- **Our reply:**
  > "Thanks — will do that."
- **Community intel extracted:**
  Novel Schema-as-a-Database approach:
  store schemas in DuckDB or Neo4j, semantic
  search via MCP server tool calls, load as
  Claude skill — only activates when invoked,
  saves significant context space
- **Impact on team:**
  Worth exploring for KB v2. Could reduce
  context footprint significantly. Flag for
  Estif and Melkam as potential architecture
  enhancement

### Token Optimisation — Community Consensus

Three independent practitioners pointed toward
the same conclusion:

> **Do not load full schemas upfront.
> Load table names first.
> Expand to full columns only for tables
> the agent selects after first-pass
> query planning.**

This directly resolves the token optimisation
open question from Day 3 mob session.
**Bring this to the next mob session
before architecture is finalised.**
